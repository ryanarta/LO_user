Info from Susan Allen 2022_08, and other notes:
- The dataset was compiled by Elise Olson.  You can check her paper
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JC015766
for how she cites it.
- The data is publicly available via the CIOOS Pacific ERDDAP server: https://data.cioospacific.ca/erddap/index.html
- They provide Citation Guidelines here in case that is helpful: https://cioospacific.ca/about/data-management/
- My experience with ERDDAP is that it is unhappy if you ask for too much: either too much in terms of data size or too much in terms of time to get it. I would suggest cutting your ask into two time periods.
- Dakota Mascarenas downloaded the data into the three files we have in LO_data/dfo1, one for the bottles and two for the casts.
