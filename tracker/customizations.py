"""
This is a module of experiment-specific customizations that are applied
within tracker.

It was motivated by the Nina Bednarsek experiments where she wanted larvae
(rockfish?) to stay at one depth for the first month and then go to a different
depth for the second month.

It is not clear to me the best way to implement such specific behaviors in the
code, so this module is an attempt.
